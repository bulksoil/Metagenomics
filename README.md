Metagenomics
============

## Tools for analyzing and processing metagenomic data.

This will include various perl scripts for analyzing and processing 16S rRNA sequences generated on the MiSeq platform.

Eventually, I am hoping that I will eventually get around to doing real metagenomics (non-targeted).  But until then, I am hoping this repository will only be for 16S.
